Name of QuantLet: CBR_BK

Published in: A Data-driven Case-based Reasoning in Bankruptcy Prediction

Description: This Quantlet is an example of training case-based reasoning and compared with other machine learning methods. The dataset is the German credit data publicly available in UCI. The credit reform data used in paper is confidential and can be collected based on requests from the Blockchain Research Center (BRC, https://blockchain-research-center.de/)

Keywords: Decision support system, Bankruptcy prediction, Case-based reasoning, Explainable machine learning, Particle swarm optimization

Additional Info: This repository implements a data-driven CBR system to investigate its explainability in bankruptcy prediction and decision. The Nvidia GPU is required to run the Python code for training the parameters of the CBR system. The benchmark models are widely used machine learning models.
